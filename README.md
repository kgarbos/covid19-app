# covid19-app
Created a Covid19 tracker with live data that tracks daily and total cases per province

- Used the Fetch API to fetch JSON covid data to sort and filter data by province.
- Used ChartJS to display covid data and a "change" eventListener to change the data based off of the province select option.
- Callback functions were used for repeated operations and to better filter the javascript code
